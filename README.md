#Blog One

Run the following rake tasks to get started:

rake db:create,

rake db:migrate,

rake db:seed

(need to run 'rake db:drop' first if you are trying to re-seed the db')

Then run shotgun or sinatra to launch web app.
You can view all seeded posts without signing in,
but to create posts you must create a user account (email does not have to be real,
I have not created validations yet).
You can create posts and add tags to your posts as well as edit existing posts that you created.
