#Blog One

Run the following rake tasks to get started:
rake db:create,
rake db:migrate,
rake db:seed

Then run shotgun or sinatra to launch web app.
You can view all seeded posts without signing in,
but to create posts you must create a user account (email does not have to be real).
You can create posts and add tags to your posts.
